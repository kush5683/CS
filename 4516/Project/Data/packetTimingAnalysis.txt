See RTT vs Time graph for comparison of openflow vs. traditional network.
We selected frame no. 10, 11, 14, 15 from test.pcap to preform an analysis on.
OVS saw the SYN from host 1 at 16.514ms and elevated the packet to the controller.
The controller had the packet for 1.2ms.
OVS received the SYN packet out at 17.715ms.
OVS elevated the SYN ACK at 18.293ms.
The controller had the packet for .9ms.
OVS got the packet out at 19.194ms.
RTT: 2.68ms

As shown above, the time taken by the controller in total was 2.1ms out of a total RTT of 2.68.
This is why Open Flow is so much slower than a traditional network when there are no relevant flow table entries.
