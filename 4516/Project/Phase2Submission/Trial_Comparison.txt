See RTT_vs_Time.png graph for comparison of OpenFlow vs. traditional network.

The data showed OpenFlow performing significantly slower than the traditional network. This was anticipated,
as the simple controller was not creating any flow rules, but simply approving every single packet that was sent
through the OVS. Due to this, each packet couldn't be simply routed through the OVS to it's destination.
Instead, each packet had to be encapsulated in an OpenFlow PACKET_IN message, elevated to the controller on
Host 4, processed by the controller, encapsulated in an OpenFlow PACKET_OUT message, sent back to the OVS,
and only then routed to its destination. This was clearly expected to cause some additional overhead when compared
to the traditional network. As anticipated, OpenFlow had significantly longer RTTs for the 100 TCP connections.
