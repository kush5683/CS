Testing was performed through packet captures and running tcpping -r 3 -x 110 www.team17.4516.cs.wpi.edu on Host 1 to perform 110 tcppings.


In test.pcap we can see many different DNS queries and answers. Packet number 4 is the initial Query from host 1 and packet number 5 is the answer from host 2.
We can see the answer in packet 5:

    Answers
        www.team17.4516.cs.wpi.edu: type A, class IN, addr 10.61.1.10
            Name: www.team17.4516.cs.wpi.edu
            Type: A (Host Address) (1)
            Class: IN (0x0001)
            Time to live: 604800 (7 days)
            Data length: 4
            Address: 10.61.1.10
The destination address is is 10.61.1.10 which does not exist on the network. If we look at seq 0 in DNS_output.txt we can see that host 1 received 
the DNS response with the edited IP address (seq 0: tcp response from 10.61.17.215 [open]  4.992 ms). 

This happens for every DNS request and response.

The next DNS query answer pair is packet number 15 and 16. This time the IP is edited to 10.61.17.170 as seen in seq 2.
