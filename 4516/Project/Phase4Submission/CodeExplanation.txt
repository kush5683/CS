Our phase4_controller.py code is similar to our controller from phase 3, but with the additional SNAT functionality of phase 4.

We achieved this by adding appropriate packet handling such that packets from Host 1's IP to a Host 3 virtual IP would be intercepted
on Host 1 and FLOW_MODs would be made to rewrite the .1 IP address with a .48/28 address, and vice versa. These .48/28 IP addresses
were tracked similarly to Host 3's virtual IPs, using a list variable named h1virtualIPs.

These FLOW_MODs were made using the Ryu OpenFlow Action OFPActionSetNwSrc and OFPActionSetNwDst.

No other changes were made since our phase 3 controller was written in such a way that the FLOW_MODs creating on Host 3's OVS would
still function properly, even if the addresses Host 3 interacted with were virtual IPs in the .48/28 range instead of the .1 IP.
